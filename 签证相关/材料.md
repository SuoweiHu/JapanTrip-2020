* [Visas](http://www.au.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/visa_enquiries.html) – Please check that your passport will be valid while you are in Japan and still be valid upon departure. The remaining period of validity doesn’t have to be six (6) months. Check that you have the relevant visa if required. Please note that Australian citizens travelling to Japan are not required to obtain a visa to enter Japan if the trip is for less than 90 days and when the visit is for tourism, a business trip, a conferences, to see relatives and friends, etc. However, when foreign nationals, including Australians, engage in paid activities in Japan a visa is required regardless of the length of stay.


* Travel Insurance – It is recommended to take out overseas travel insurance.
    *  Overseas travel insurance makes you feel secure, even in emergencies, and you can enjoy your trip.

    * Medical expenses can be very high in Japan. If the travel insurance you purchased offers sufficient coverage of treatment costs, you can receive treatment without concern.
    *  It is recommended to have overseas travel insurance with travel support for hospital referrals, medical interpretation, and cashless medical service. (We recommend that you check your insurance details before travelling. For example, perinatal medical care is not covered by travel insurance and can be expensive.)

* ~~[Bringing Medicine into Japan](http://www.au.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/visa_medicine_en.html) – Are you taking medicines into Japan? Certain requirements and rules apply when bringing medicines for personal use into Japan. These rules and requirements differ depending on the type and amount of medicine being imported.~~

* ~~[Vaccinations](http://www.au.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/visa_vaccinations_en.html) – Do you require any vaccinations before you go to Japan? Generally speaking, no vaccinations are required when travelling to Japan, however you may want to be vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis or Measles if recommended by your doctor.~~

* [Customs](http://www.au.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/visa_customs_en.html) – Will you be taking goods exceeding duty free allowances? Other items like alcohol, perfume, cigarettes, commercial goods and large amounts of cash?

* ~~[Quarantine](http://www.au.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/visa_quarantine_en.html) – Passengers bringing plants and plant products (including fruits, vegetables, and seeds) or animals and animals products (including meat products, milk, eggs) into Japan must have them inspected at the Plant and Animal Quarantine counter and have relevant certification/documentation~~.

* ~~[Food](http://www.au.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/visa_quarantine_en.html) – Will you be taking any food into Japan? Highly processed foods (Tim tams, biscuits, tea, lollies etc.) generally don’t need an inspection and you can go straight through customs but if you are unsure, please check with the relevant Quarantine station.~~

* [Mobile Sim Cards](http://www.au.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/visa_mobile_en.html) – Before you head off to Japan make sure that you know who your Network providers roaming partner is in Japan. There is a good chance that your mobile phone will work in Japan, although you may not like the exorbitant usage charges for the voice and data. The airports are full of phone rental places but you also may like to shop online and investigate what is the best deal for you before you go.
